# My Webpage

A new webpage I created after acquiring the .dev domain. Composed using UIkit (A framework I fell in love in after employing it in the `emc-sbm-app` project). It's a vast improvement from my [old webpage](https://github.com/MM-coder/MM-coder.github.io) which I was proud of for being fully custom HTML & CSS after embarking on this project I observed that it doesn't matter, what remains meaningful is the content. I went for minimalistic style with only 3 colours used and a sole emojicon in the intro. I strived to utilise the latest technologies that were mostly neglected in the previous webpage (Like SVGs). I kept my focus mostly on the content, not the style.
